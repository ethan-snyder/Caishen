# InvestingCalc
  The Goal of this project is to provide a single cohesive solution to aide in the investigation of Securities & specifically stock equities. My personal investment strategies are not based off of technical indicators and instead are long term. Regardless, information included in this program includes that of technicals and non-technicals. InvestingCalc inquires as to the security that the user wishes to investigate, and then, using yfinance, grabs information such as stock price, shares outstanding, net income, et cetera. Using this recently obtained information, InvestingCalc calculates certain metrics including but not limited to WACC, Cash Per Share, CAPM, CAGR, et cetera. In addition to information gathered and generated about securities, InvestingCalc gathers general market data including sentiment related metrics and index prices (S&P, DJI, Russel).

While I have a lot of plans for explanding this program, please consult the issues tab for more information on future implementations.
