# InvestingCalc
The Goal of this project is to provide a single cohesive solution to aide in the investigation of Securities & specifically stock equities. My personal investment strategies are not based off of technical indicators and instead are long term. Regardless, information included in this program includes that of technicals and non-technicals. InvestingCalc inquires as to the security that the user wishes to investigate, and then, using yfinance, grabs information such as stock price, shares outstanding, net income, et cetera. Using this recently obtained information, InvestingCalc calculates certain metrics including but not limited to WACC, Cash Per Share, CAPM, CAGR, et cetera.

**Disclaimer: None of the information obtained in this code is financial advice. Information obtained using this program may be inaccurate.**
